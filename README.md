# HistoricalReactiveCommand
HistoricalReactiveCommand for [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI).

The creation and logic of work is as similar as possible to conventional [reactive commands](https://www.reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/commands/).

# A Compelling Example
## Simple command with History
 ```C#
    //Registry default history. You can set your IScheduler here
    History.RegistryDefaultHistory();
    
    int myNumber = 0;
    var command = ReactiveCommandEx.CreateWithHistory<int>("adding",
     (number) => { myNumber += number; },
     (number) => { myNumber -= number; });

    //myNumber is 25
    command.Execute(25).Subscribe();
    //myNumber is 50
    command.Execute(25).Subscribe();
    //myNumber is 25
    command.History.Undo.Execute().Subscribe();
    //myNumber is 0
    command.History.Undo.Execute().Subscribe();
    //myNumber is 25
    command.History.Redo.Execute().Subscribe();
     //myNumber is 50
    command.History.Redo.Execute().Subscribe();
                       
 ```
